This course is part of the TensorFlow: Advanced techniques specialization offered by DeepLearning.AI.

I have uploaded the assignments that I have done throughout this course. 
This course covers advanced techniques for building neural network models using TensorFlow, including:

Comparing and contrasting the Functional and Sequential APIs to discover new models that can be built with the Functional API. This includes building a model that produces multiple outputs, such as a Siamese network.

Developing custom loss functions, such as the contrastive loss function used in a Siamese network, to measure model performance and improve learning from training data.

Building custom layers for models, including network layers using lambda functions, and exploring activation functions.

Adding custom functionality to existing models by defining custom classes, rather than relying on the Functional or Sequential APIs. This includes building a residual network (ResNet) by defining a custom model class.
